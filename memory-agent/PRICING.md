## Core Philosophy

**Privacy should not be a luxury.**

Memory Agent is open source and free to use. The project is designed to run entirely on your local hardware with no recurring costs or subscriptions.

## Open Source Model

- No attribution required (but appreciated!)

### What's Free Forever
- ✅ Full source code
- ✅ All core features

## Sustainability Strategy

While the software is free, sustainable open source requires funding. Here are potential revenue streams that don't compromise privacy:

### 1. **Optional Paid Support** (Future)
- Enterprise support contracts
- Priority bug fixes
- Custom integration assistance
- Training and workshops

**Pricing**: $500-$2000/month for organizations

### 2. **Managed Hardware Recommendations**
- Affiliate links for recommended hardware (NAS, mini PCs)
- Pre-configured devices with Memory Agent installed
- No markup on software, just hardware convenience

**Pricing**: Hardware cost + $50-100 setup fee

### 3. **Premium Model Packs** (Optional)
- Curated, tested, optimized model bundles
- Fine-tuned models for specific domains
- Early access to experimental features

**Pricing**: $10-30 one-time per model pack

**Note**: All models remain open source. Payment is for curation and convenience, not exclusivity.

### 4. **Corporate Licensing** (Future)
- Optional commercial license for companies wanting legal guarantees
- SLA and indemnification for enterprise users
- Does not restrict the open source version

**Pricing**: $5000-$25000/year based on company size

### 5. **Donations & Sponsorships**
- GitHub Sponsors
- Open Collective
- Patreon for sustained development

**Suggested**: $5-20/month from users who find value

## What We'll NEVER Do

❌ **Charge for core features** - Base functionality stays free
❌ **Collect user data** - No analytics, no telemetry, no tracking
❌ **Freemium with locked features** - No artificial limitations
❌ **Sell user data** - Your data is yours, period
❌ **Require cloud subscriptions** - Local-first, always
❌ **Show ads** - Ever.

## Cost of Self-Hosting
